# asterisk.tmbundle
It's a simple TextMate syntax highlight bundle for asterisk dialplan script language. 


By default, PyCharm and other IntelliJ IDEs don't have dialplan support. 
It brings some challenges in the development process. I wrote TextMate bundle to have dialplan syntax highlighting in PyCharm.
